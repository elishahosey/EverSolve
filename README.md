## ðŸŒ± Purpose

EverSolve is my personal journey to master algorithms, problem-solving, and mathematical thinkingâ€”one puzzle at a time. 

Built as a full-stack tool, it helps me track my progress, visualize algorithmic concepts I struggle with, and keep my notes and insights in one place. Inspired by a mix of LeetCode grind, math puzzle books, and a desire to grow beyond coding just for work, EverSolve is both dojo and journal.

This project is a lifelong commitment to staying sharp, curious, and always improvingâ€”designed by me, for me (but open for anyone on the same path).
