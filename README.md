# 🧠 EverSolve

*A lifelong quest to get better at solving hard problems—one commit at a time.*

*Me vs. Dynamic Programming*

## 🌱 Purpose

EverSolve is my personal dojo for algorithmic growth. It's where I log problems, visualize what confuses me, write notes I’ll actually revisit, and get smarter at solving stuff that makes me go “bruh.”

> Because job searching is brutal, and LeetCode doesn’t care about your feelings.

## 🔮 What Will Get Done

- 📈 Tracks my progress solving algorithm challenges
- 🎨 Visualizes tricky concepts (e.g., recursion trees, heaps)
- 📝 Centralizes my notes & problem-solving patterns
- 🧩 Serves up puzzles from books or custom problems
- 📊 Logs everything to Excel like a true data nerd

## 💬 Final Word

EverSolve is powered by overthinking, mild obsession with graphs, and an undying fear of technical interviews.
